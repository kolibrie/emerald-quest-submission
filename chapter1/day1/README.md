1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp

A blockchain is a way to store data in a decentralized way, using
cryptography to verify that the data has not been tampered with.
It is called a blockchain because the internal organization of
the database is a sequential chain of blocks, each holding the
data written during a small period of time, and each linked to the
block immediately preceeding it.

2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts

A smart contract is a set of computer instructions that allow
people to interact with the data on a blockchain.

3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

A script is part of a smart contract that allows people to read
or view information from the blockchain.  It does not cost money
to interact with a script.

A transaction is part of a smart contract that allows people to
write data to the blockchain.  It costs money to run a
transaction.
