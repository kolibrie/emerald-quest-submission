### Day 2

1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

- Safety and security: it should be easy to write code that is
  secure and hard to write code that is insecure.
- Clarity: it should be easy to read and understand Cadence code.
- Approachability: it should feel familiar to programmers of
  other languages, making it easy to transition.
- Developer Experience: it should not be frustrating to debug.
- Resource Oriented Programming: actions within the code relate
  to resources.

2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

- Safety and Security: if it is easy to write secure code, it
  will take less effort to make sure a program is has the desired
  degree of security.
- Clarity: if the code is easy to read and understand, it will be
  easier to find bugs and easier to add functionality where it
  makes sense.
- Approachability: if it is easy for programmers to transition to
  Cadence, there will be more people who learn it.
- Developer Experience: if it is fun to program in, and not
  frustrating to debug, programmers will want to continue using
  it.
- Resource Oriented Programming: if it is easy to keep track of
  resources, it will be easier to write transactions that do the
  intended thing.
